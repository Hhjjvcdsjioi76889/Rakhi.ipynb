# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning**.  
It applies data preprocessing, handles class imbalance, and evaluates multiple ML models to achieve high accuracy in fraud detection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze transaction data for fraud patterns.
- Handle **imbalanced dataset** using SMOTE oversampling.
- Train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
- Achieve high precision & recall for fraud detection.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Jupyter Notebook
